# Linksys Routers

Monitor your Smart WiFi-enabled Linksys routers, keep track of connected or disconnected devices, monitor the router's connectivity, and control your router from within Homey

Installation Insturctions:
1. Open the app setup page, enter your router IP address and you administrator's credentials
2. Click "Save Settings" and wait till you get the "Connected Succesfully" message
3. Close settings window and add your device

NOTE: Currently, the only supported device is "Linksys Velop WHW03 Mesh Router", since its the only one I have for testing.
If you have another Smart WiFi-enabled Linksys Router that you would like me to support, please feel free to request and I will be happy to try and support your router.
